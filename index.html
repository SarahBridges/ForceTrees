<h3>3 Datasets for Force Trees</h3>

<h4>Class Schedules
</h4>
<p>A force tree could be used to represent a dataset of students who have certain 
classes with other students in the dataset. For example if Jenny has Psychology with 
Martin and Spanish with Lisa; and Martin has Psychology with Jenny, Biology with Kim, 
and Latin with Susan; and Lisa has Spanish with Jenny and Chemistry with Kim; and Kim 
has Biology with Martin and Psychology with Susan; and Susan has Latin with Martin and 
Psychology with Kim. Below is an example dataset that could be used to construct a 
force tree for this scenario.
</p>
<p>
var dataset = { nodes: [
                        { name: "Jenny" },
                        { name: "Martin" },
                        { name: "Lisa" },
                        { name: "Susan" },
                        { name: "Kim" },
                       ], 
                 edges: [
                         { source: 0, target: 1 },
                         { source: 0, target: 2 },
                         { source: 1, target: 4 },
                         { source: 2, target: 4 },
                         { source: 3, target: 1 },
                         { source: 3, target: 4 },
                        ]
              };
</p>

<h4>Employee Schedule
</h4>
<p>Another dataset that could be visualized with a force tree is a work schedule for a 
set of employees. For example, Jenny works Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays; Martin 
works Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays; Lisa works Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays; 
Susan works Tuesdays and Thursdays; Kim works Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. 
Below is an example dataset that could be used to construct a force tree for this 
scenario.
</p>
<p>
var dataset = { nodes: [
                        { name: "Jenny" },
                        { name: "Martin" },
                        { name: "Lisa" },
                        { name: "Susan" },
                        { name: "Kim" },
                       ], 
                 edges: [
                         { source: 0, target: 1 },
                         { source: 0, target: 2 },
                         { source: 0, target: 4 },
                         { source: 1, target: 2 },
                         { source: 1, target: 3 },
                         { source: 1, target: 4 },
                         { source: 2, target: 3 },
                         { source: 2, target: 4 },
                         { source: 3, target: 4 },
                        ]
              };
</p>

<h4>Group Projects
</h4>
<p>A force tree could also represent a dataset of what movies people have seen. For
example if Jenny has seen <i>Kung Fu Panda</i> and <i>Infinity War</i>; Martin has 
seen <i>Grapes of Wrath</i> and <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>; Lisa has seen <i>Kung Fu 
Panda</i> and <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>; Susan has seen <i>Infinity War</i> and 
<i>Spider Man</i>; and Kim has seen <i>Spider Man</i> and <i>Grapes of Wrath</i>. 
Below is an example dataset that could be used to construct a force tree for this 
scenario.

<p>
var dataset = { nodes: [
                        { name: "Jenny" },
                        { name: "Martin" },
                        { name: "Lisa" },
                        { name: "Susan" },
                        { name: "Kim" },
                       ], 
                 edges: [
                         { source: 0, target: 2 },
                         { source: 0, target: 3 },
                         { source: 1, target: 2 },
                         { source: 1, target: 4 },
                         { source: 3, target: 4 },
                        ]
              };
